## Slots

| Name | Range | Cardinality | Description  | Info |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [subject](subject.md) | [NucleicAcidEntity](NucleicAcidEntity.md) | 1..1 | connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.  | . |
| [predicate](predicate.md) | [predicate_type](predicate_type.md) | 1..1 | A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes.  | . |
| [object](object.md) | [NucleicAcidEntity](NucleicAcidEntity.md) | 1..1 | connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.  | . |

| [negated](negated.md) | [boolean](boolean.md) | 0..1 | if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true  | . |
| [qualifiers](qualifiers.md) | [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md) | 0..* | connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association  | . |

| [has_evidence](has_evidence.md) | [EvidenceType](EvidenceType.md) | 0..* | connects an association to an instance of supporting evidence  | . |
| [knowledge_source](knowledge_source.md) | [InformationResource](InformationResource.md) | 0..* | An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property.  | . |
| [original_knowledge_source](original_knowledge_source.md) | [InformationResource](InformationResource.md) | 0..* | The Information Resource that created the original record of the knowledge expressed in an Association (e.g. via curation of the knowledge from the literature, or generation of the knowledge de novo through computation, reasoning, inference over data).  | . |
| [primary_knowledge_source](primary_knowledge_source.md) | [InformationResource](InformationResource.md) | 0..* | The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify (may or may not be the 'original' source).  | . |
| [aggregator_knowledge_source](aggregator_knowledge_source.md) | [InformationResource](InformationResource.md) | 0..* | An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form.  | . |
| [id](id.md) | [string](string.md) | 1..1 | A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI  | . |
| [iri](iri.md) | [iri_type](iri_type.md) | 0..1 | An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.  | . |
| [category](category.md) | [category_type](category_type.md) | 0..* | Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}  | . |
| [type](type.md) | [string](string.md) | 0..1 | None  | . |
| [name](name.md) | [label_type](label_type.md) | 0..1 | A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.  | . |
| [description](description.md) | [narrative_text](narrative_text.md) | 0..1 | a human-readable description of an entity  | . |
| [source](source.md) | [string](string.md) | 0..1 | None  | . |
| [has_attribute](has_attribute.md) | [Attribute](Attribute.md) | 0..* | connects any entity to an attribute  | . |
