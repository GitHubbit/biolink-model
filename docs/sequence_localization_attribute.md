# Slot: sequence_localization_attribute
_An attribute that can be applied to a genome sequence localization edge. These edges connect a nucleic acid entity such as an exon to an entity such as a chromosome. Edge properties are used to ascribe specific positional information and other metadata to the localization. In pragmatic terms this can be thought of as columns in a GFF3 line._
