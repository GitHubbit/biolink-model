    * Description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology, but it can be any edge CURIE.
    * range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)
 * [object](object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.

    * range: [Provider](Provider.md)

### Inherited from entity to feature or disease qualifiers:

 * [severity qualifier](severity_qualifier.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>

 * [onset qualifier](onset_qualifier.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state when the phenotype appears is in the subject
    * range: [Onset](Onset.md)

### Inherited from entity to phenotypic feature association:

 * [sex qualifier](sex_qualifier.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state whether the association is specific to a particular sex.
    * range: [BiologicalSex](BiologicalSex.md)
 * [entity to phenotypic feature association➞description](entity_to_phenotypic_feature_association_description.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A description of specific aspects of this phenotype, not otherwise covered by the phenotype ontology class
