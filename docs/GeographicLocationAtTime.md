## Attributes


### Inherited from entity:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [iri](iri.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
     * Range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}
     * Range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [type](type.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [description](description.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: a human-readable description of an entity
     * Range: [NarrativeText](types/NarrativeText.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [source](source.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [has attribute](has_attribute.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: connects any entity to an attribute
     * Range: [Attribute](Attribute.md)
     * in subsets: (samples)

### Inherited from exposure event:

 * [timepoint](timepoint.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: a point in time
     * Range: [TimeType](types/TimeType.md)

### Inherited from geographic location:

 * [latitude](latitude.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: latitude
     * Range: [Float](types/Float.md)
 * [longitude](longitude.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: longitude
     * Range: [Float](types/Float.md)

### Inherited from macromolecular machine mixin:

 * [name](name.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.
     * Range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)

### Inherited from named thing:

 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: The value in this node property represents the knowledge provider that created or assembled the node and all of its attributes.  Used internally to represent how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph.
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
