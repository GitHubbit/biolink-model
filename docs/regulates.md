# Relation: regulates


A more specific form of affects, that implies the effect results from a biologically evolved control mechanism. Gene-affects-gene relationships will (almost) always involve regulation.  Chemical-affects-gene relationships  may in some cases be considered regulation (if the chemical is some endogenously produced signaling molecule  created to execute a certain function/activity), but exogenous/environmental chemical-affects-gene relationships  are usually not cases of regulation.
