# Class: GeneToGeneHomologyAssociation


A homology association between two genes. May be orthology (in which case the species of subject and object should differ) or paralogy (in which case the species may be the same)

## Attributes


### Own

 * [gene to gene homology association➞predicate](gene_to_gene_homology_association_predicate.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: homology relationship type
    * range: [PredicateType](types/PredicateType.md)

### Inherited from association:

 * [subject](subject.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [predicate](predicate.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes.
    * range: [PredicateType](types/PredicateType.md)
 * [object](object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [relation](relation.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology, but it can be any edge CURIE.
    * range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)
 * [negated](negated.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
    * range: [Boolean](types/Boolean.md)
 * [qualifiers](qualifiers.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
 * [publications](publications.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to publications supporting the association
    * range: [Publication](Publication.md)
 * [association➞type](association_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [association➞category](association_category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * range: [Association](Association.md)

### Inherited from entity:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a resource. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [iri](iri.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
    * range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [type](type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [description](description.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a human-readable description of a thing
    * range: [NarrativeText](types/NarrativeText.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [source](source.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a lightweight analog to the association class 'has provider' slot, which is the string name, or the authoritative (i.e. database) namespace, designating the origin of the entity to which the slot belongs.
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it
    * range: [Agent](Agent.md)

### Inherited from gene to gene association:

 * [gene to gene association➞subject](gene_to_gene_association_subject.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md)
 * [gene to gene association➞object](gene_to_gene_association_object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: the object gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md)

### Inherited from material sample:

 * [has attribute](has_attribute.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects any named thing to an attribute
    * range: [Attribute](Attribute.md)
    * in subsets: (samples)

### Domain for slot:

 * [gene to gene homology association➞predicate](gene_to_gene_homology_association_predicate.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: homology relationship type
    * range: [PredicateType](types/PredicateType.md)
