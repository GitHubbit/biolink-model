# Slot: authors
_connects an publication to the list of authors who contributed to the publication. This property should be a comma-delimited list of author names. It is recommended that an author's name be formatted as "surname, firstname initial.".   Note that this property is a node annotation expressing the citation list of authorship which might typically otherwise be more completely documented in biolink:PublicationToProviderAssociation defined edges which point to full details about an author and possibly, some qualifiers which clarify the specific status of a given author in the publication._
