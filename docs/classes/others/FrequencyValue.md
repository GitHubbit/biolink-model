## Parents

 *  is_a: [Attribute](Attribute.md) - A property or characteristic of an entity. For example, an apple may have properties such as color, shape, age, crispiness. An environmental sample may have attributes such as depth, lat, long, material.

## Referenced by class

 *  **[Association](Association.md)** *[frequency qualifier](frequency_qualifier.md)*  <sub>OPT</sub>  **[FrequencyValue](FrequencyValue.md)**

## Attributes


### Inherited from attribute:

 * [has attribute type](has_attribute_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects an attribute to a class that describes it
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
    * in subsets: (samples)
 * [has quantitative value](has_quantitative_value.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an attribute to a value
    * range: [QuantityValue](QuantityValue.md)
    * in subsets: (samples)
 * [has qualitative value](has_qualitative_value.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects an attribute to a value
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (samples)

### Inherited from gene product:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from named thing:

 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `bl:Protein`, `bl:GeneProduct`, `bl:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {bl:GenomicEntity, bl:MolecularEntity, bl:NamedThing}
    * range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
