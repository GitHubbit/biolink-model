description: A small molecule entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability
  in small-molecule databases of SMILES, InChI, IUPAC, or other unambiguous representation
  of its precise chemical structure; for convenience of representation, any valid
  chemical representation is included, even if it is not strictly molecular (e.g.,
  sodium ion).
